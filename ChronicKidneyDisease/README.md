# 🩺 Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction App

This project is a full-stack **machine learning web application** designed to analyze and predict **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** based on patient medical parameters. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and a trained model to provide both predictions and medical insights.
