AMIT_DEPI (GP)

Welcome to the **Healthcare Predictive Analysis** project! This repository aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of various healthcare conditions, helping professionals take early action and enhance patient care.

## ðŸ©º **Project Overview**

This project develops predictive models for five major healthcare conditions. Each model is tailored to predict the likelihood of a specific disease based on a variety of patient data points, such as age, lifestyle factors, and medical history. The ultimate goal is to provide healthcare professionals with tools to make informed decisions for early diagnosis and prevention.
